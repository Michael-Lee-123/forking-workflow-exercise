taco
This is the tastiest bean filling, and incidentally first search result in Google (BBC goodfood):

Ingredients:
    1 tbsp vegetable oil
    3 garlic cloves, chopped
    3 x 400g cans black beans, drained and rinsed
    3 tbsp cider vinegar
    1 ½ tbsp honey
    1 ½ tbsp smoked paprika
    1 ½ tbsp ground cumin
    
Instructions:
    In a large frying pan, heat the oil and add the garlic. Fry until golden, then add the beans. Pour in the cider vinegar, honey and spices along with 1 tsp or more of salt, to taste. Cook until warmed through, crushing gently with the back of your wooden spoon, then set aside. Put 1-2 heaped tbsp of beans on a tortilla.
